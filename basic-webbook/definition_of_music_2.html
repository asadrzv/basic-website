        <h1>Defintion of Music</h1>

        <p>
            Does the definition of music determine its aspects, or does the combination of certain aspects determine the definition of music? 
            For example, intensional definitions list aspects or elements that make up their subject.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some definitions refer to music as a score, or a composition. Music can be read as well as heard, and a piece of music written but 
            never played is a piece of music notwithstanding. According to Edward E. Gordon the process of reading music, at least for trained 
            musicians, involves a process, called "inner hearing" or "audiation", where the music is heard in the mind as if it were being played.
            This suggests that while sound is often considered a required aspect of music, it might not be.

        <p>
            Jean Molino points out that "any element belonging to the total musical fact can be isolated, or taken as a strategic variable of 
            musical production." Nattiez gives as examples Mauricio Kagel's Con Voce [with voice], where a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. 
            In this example sound, a common element, is excluded, while gesture, a less common element, is given primacy. However Nattiez goes on to say 
            that despite special cases where sound is not immediately obvious (because it is heard in the mind): "sound is a minimal condition of the 
            musical fact".
