        <h1>Universal Aspect</h1>

        <p>
            There is disagreement about whether some aspects of music are universal, as well as whether the concept of music is 
            universal. This debate often hinges on definitions. For instance, the fairly common assertion that "tonality" is a 
            universal of all music may necessarily require an expansive definition of tonality. A pulse is sometimes taken as a 
            universal, yet there exist solo vocal and instrumental genres with free and improvisational rhythms no regular pulse, 
            one example being the alap section of an Indian classical music performance. Harwood questions whether a 
            "cross-cultural musical universal" may be found in the music or in the making of music, including performance, hearing, 
            conception, and education.

        <p>
            One aspect that is important to bear in mind when examining multi-cultural associations, is that an English-language word 
            (i.e. the word "music"), not a universal concept, is the object of scrutiny. For this reason it is important to approach 
            apparently equivalent words in other languages with caution. Based on the many disparate definitions that can be found 
            just in English language dictionaries, it seems there is no agreement on what the word "Music" means in English, 
            let alone determining a potentially equivalent word from another culture.

            Kenneth Gourlay describes how, since different cultures include different elements in their definitions of music, dance, 
            and related concepts, translation of the words for these activities may split or combine them, citing Nigerian musicologist 
            Chinyere Nwachukwu's definition of the Igbo term "nkwa" as an activity combining and/or requiring singing, playing musical 
            instruments, and dancing. He then concludes that there exists "nonuniversality of music and the universality of nonmusic".
