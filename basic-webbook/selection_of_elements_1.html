        <h1>Selection of Elements</h1>

        <p>
            According to Howard, there is little dispute about the principal constituent elements of music, 
            though experts differ on their precise definitions. Harold Owen bases his list on the qualities of 
            sound: pitch, timbre, intensity, and duration while John Castellini excludes duration. Most 
            definitions of music include a reference to sound and sound perception can be divided into six cognitive 
            processes. They are: pitch, duration, loudness, timbre, sonic texture and spatial location.

        <p>
            A 'parameter' is any element that can be manipulated (composed) separately from other elements or focused 
            on separately in an educational context. Leonard B. Meyer compares distinguishing parameters within a culture 
            by their different constraints to distinguishing independent parameters within music, such as melody, harmony, 
            timbre, "etc." The first person to apply the term parameter to music may have been Joseph Schillinger, though 
            its relative popularity may be due to Werner Meyer-Eppler. Gradation is gradual change within one parameter, 
            or an overlapping of two blocks of sound.

            Meyer lists melody, rhythm, timbre, harmony, "and the like" as principal elements of music, while Narmour lists 
            melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, tessitura, timbre, tempo, meter, texture, "and perhaps others". According to 
            McClellan, two things should be considered, the quality or state of an element and its change over time. Alan P. 
            Merriam proposed a theoretical research model that assumes three aspects are always present in musical activity: 
            concept, behaviour, and sound. Virgil Thomson lists the "raw materials" of music in order of their supposed 
            discovery: rhythm, melody, and harmony; including counterpoint and orchestration. Near the end of the twentieth 
            century music scholarship began to give more attention to social and physical elements of music. For example: 
            performance, social, gender, dance, and theatre.
