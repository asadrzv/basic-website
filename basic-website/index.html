                    <p> Pictured above: The Beatles</p>
                    <p> Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs 
                        in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. 
                        The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession 
                        of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein 
                        moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their 
                        recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 
                        1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania", the band acquired 
                        the nickname "the Fab Four", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes 
                        given the informal title of "fifth Beatle".

                    <p> By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the "British Invasion" of the United States 
                        pop market, breaking numerous sales records, and inspiring Britain's cultural resurgence. They soon made 
                        their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced records of greater 
                        complexity, including the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club 
                        Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as "the White Album", 1968) 
                        and Abbey Road (1969). Heralding the album era, their success elevated the album to be the dominant form of 
                        record consumption over singles; they also inspired a greater public interest in psychedelic drugs and 
                        Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. 
                        In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects 
                        related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo 
                        artists. Lennon was shot and killed in 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr 
                        remain musically active.
